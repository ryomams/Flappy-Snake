# Flappy-Snake
C++ Project for Laney College's CIS 25, Using SFML

## Running This Project
This project makes use of the [CMake template repo for SFML](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project?tab=readme-ov-file), but I didn't use git when developing so there's no commit history teehee I'm not uploading my built binaries here, you'll have to do it yourself. To run and build this project:

1. Make sure CMake is installed on your system.
2. Download and unzip this repo, or clone it with a git client.
3. Using CMake from the command line, run
  ```
  cmake -B build
  cmake --build build
  ```
  and also make sure your working directory is of this project...
4. CMake will have built an executable in /build of this folder...... enjoy!!
